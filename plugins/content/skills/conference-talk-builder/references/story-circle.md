# Story Circle for Tech Talks

Eight-step narrative framework for structuring conference presentations.

## The Structure

```
        ORDER (Comfort Zone)
           1. Introduction
           2. Problem
    8. Results      3. Exploration
           ↑           ↓
    7. Apply      4. Experiment
           ↑           ↓
    6. Challenges  5. Solution
           CHAOS (Unknown)
```

## Mapping to Tech Talks

### 1. Introduction (You)
Set the scene with existing workflow or technology.
- "Our codebase was..."
- "We were using..."

### 2. Problem Statement (Need)
Articulate what's not working.
- "But then we noticed..."
- "The problem was..."

### 3. Exploration (Go)
First steps into the unknown.
- "We started researching..."
- "Our first attempt was..."

### 4. Experimentation (Search)
The messy middle of discovery.
- "We tried several approaches..."
- "After some digging..."

### 5. Solution (Find)
The breakthrough.
- "The key insight was..."
- "What finally worked..."

### 6. Challenges (Take)
Implementation difficulties.
- "It wasn't perfect..."
- "We had to deal with..."

### 7. Apply Knowledge (Return)
Bringing it back to real-world use.
- "In production..."
- "We rolled this out..."

### 8. Results & Insights (Change)
The new status quo and lessons.
- "Now we..."
- "The key takeaway..."

## Example: TypeScript Migration

1. **Introduction**: JavaScript codebase, 50k LOC
2. **Problem**: Runtime errors, refactoring fear
3. **Exploration**: Researched TypeScript, talked to teams using it
4. **Experimentation**: Pilot on one module
5. **Solution**: Incremental migration with strict mode
6. **Challenges**: Third-party types, build time increase
7. **Apply**: Full codebase over 6 months
8. **Results**: 40% fewer bugs, confident refactoring

## Key Principle

**You don't need to be an expert.** Focus on how you approached a problem and solved it. The journey is the story.
