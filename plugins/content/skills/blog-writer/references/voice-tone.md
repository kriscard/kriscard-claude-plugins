# Voice and Tone Guide

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Tone
**Technical-educator with peer-level credibility**. Write like explaining to a smart colleague who knows fundamentals but wants deeper understanding.

### Formality
**Professional-casual**. Formal enough for technical credibility, casual enough to feel like a knowledgeable peer.

### Perspective
**First-person, inclusive**. Use "I" for personal experience and "we/us" to include the reader. Creates shared journey rather than lecture.

### Technical Depth
Assume intermediate developer knowledge. Don't explain basics, but explain _why_ features exist.

## Writing Patterns

### Opening Strategy
- Start with personal narrative or motivation
- Establish relevance immediately
- Hook with problem, question, or relatable situation

### Body Structure
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Use em-dashes for elaboration
- Vary paragraph length (some single-sentence for emphasis)

### Technical Content
- Show actual code, not just describe it
- Short, focused examples (10-20 lines max)
- Real-world scenarios, not foo/bar examples
- Follow code blocks with interpretation

### Closing Strategy
- Synthesis and summary of key learnings
- Forward-looking statement
- Actionable takeaway

## Inclusive Language

- "This gives us..."
- "As you might expect..."
- "You'll notice..."
- "Let's look at..."

## Do's
- Write like explaining to a smart colleague
- Admit uncertainty or being wrong
- Use specific examples with real details
- Show the journey, not just the destination
- Use "we" and "us" to include the reader

## Don'ts
- Use corporate or marketing speak
- Over-explain basic concepts
- Pretend to have all the answers
- Start with "In this post, I will..."
- Use "As we all know..."
- Force humor or excessive emojis
