# Story Circle Framework

Eight-step narrative framework adapted from Dan Harmon's storytelling technique.

## The Structure

```
        ORDER (Comfort Zone)
           1. You
           2. Need
    8. Change      3. Go
           ↑        ↓
    7. Return    4. Search
           ↑        ↓
    6. Take      5. Find
           CHAOS (Unknown)
```

## The Eight Steps

### 1. Introduction (You)
Introduce the current status quo.
- "I was using X, and it worked fine..."

### 2. Problem Statement (Need)
Identify the problem or motivation.
- "But then I noticed..." or "The problem was..."

### 3. Exploration (Go)
Stepping into the unknown.
- "I decided to try..." or "My first attempt was..."

### 4. Experimentation (Search)
Process of discovery.
- "After some digging..." or "I discovered that..."

### 5. Solution (Find)
The breakthrough moment.
- "Then I found..." or "The key insight was..."

### 6. Challenges (Take)
Implementation difficulties.
- "It wasn't perfect..." or "The challenge was..."

### 7. Apply Knowledge (Return)
Bringing the solution back.
- "I applied this to..." or "In practice..."

### 8. Results & Insights (Change)
The new status quo.
- "Now I..." or "The key takeaway is..."

## When to Use

**Good fit:**
- Tutorial posts with discovery journey
- "How I solved X" posts
- Migration or adoption stories
- Problem → Solution narratives

**Not every post needs it:**
- Quick TILs
- Reference documentation
- Pure how-to guides

## Simplified Patterns

### The Discovery Arc (5 steps)
1. Status quo → 2. Problem → 5. Solution → 7. Application → 8. Insights

### The Learning Journey (4 steps)
1. I thought X → 4. I tried Y → 5. I learned Z → 8. Now I do W

### The Quick Win (3 steps)
2. Problem → 5. Solution → 8. Takeaway
