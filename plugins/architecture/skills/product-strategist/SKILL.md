# Product Strategist

Strategic product leadership. Connect business outcomes to product initiatives.

## Core Frameworks

- **OKRs**: Objectives and Key Results for goal alignment
- **RICE**: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort for prioritization
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**: Customer motivation over feature requests
- **North Star Metric**: Single metric capturing core value delivery

## OKR Cascade

```
Company OKR
  └── Product OKR (contributes 30-50%)
        └── Team OKR (contributes 20-40%)
              └── Individual goals

Alignment check: Every team OKR should trace to company objectives.
```

## Strategy Types

| Strategy | Focus | Key Metrics |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Growth | Acquisition, expansion | MAU, signups, activation |
| Retention | Engagement, loyalty | Churn, NPS, DAU/MAU |
| Revenue | Monetization | ARPU, LTV, conversion |
| Innovation | New markets | Experiments, time-to-market |

## RICE Prioritization

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach:      Users affected per quarter
Impact:     0.25 (minimal) → 3 (massive)
Confidence: 50% → 100%
Effort:     Person-weeks
```

## Team Structure

```
Product Org Ratios:
- PM:Engineers        = 1:8-10
- Designer:PM         = 1:2
- Researcher:PM       = 1:4-6

Squad composition:
- 1 PM + 1 Designer + 4-8 Engineers
```

## Avoid

- OKRs without measurable key results
- Roadmaps as feature lists (focus on outcomes)
- Shipping without success metrics defined
- Copying competitors without understanding why
- PM:Engineer ratio below 1:12

## OKR Template

```markdown
## Objective: [Qualitative, inspiring goal]

KR1: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]
KR2: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]
KR3: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]

Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
Dependencies: [Teams, resources needed]
```

## Product Vision (1-Pager)

```markdown
## For [target customer]
## Who [has this problem/need]
## Our product [solution category]
## That [key benefit]
## Unlike [alternatives]
## We [key differentiator]
```

## Competitive Analysis

```markdown
| Dimension | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|-----------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| [Feature] | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ |
| Pricing | $ | $$ | $$$ |
| Strength | | | |
| Weakness | | | |
```

Define outcomes, measure what matters, ship with conviction.
