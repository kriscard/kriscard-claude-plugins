# Explain Codebase

Scan the codebase and provide a clear, accessible explanation of:

## How It Works

1. **What does this project do?**
   - Main purpose in plain language
   - Key features and capabilities

2. **How is it organized?**
   - Main folders and what they contain
   - Entry points (where execution starts)

3. **How do the pieces connect?**
   - Data flow from user action to result
   - Key integrations between components

4. **What are the most important files?**
   - Core business logic locations
   - Configuration files that matter

## Output Format

- Use simple language, avoid jargon
- Include a high-level diagram if helpful
- Point out non-obvious connections
- Highlight patterns used

Make it easy for someone new to understand the codebase structure and how everything fits together.
