# Confidence Assessment Rubric

Use this rubric to score brain dump clarity before generating a contract.

**Threshold**: 95 points minimum to proceed to contract generation.

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Problem Clarity (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Problem not stated or completely unclear |
| 6-10 | Problem mentioned but vague |
| 11-15 | Problem clear but missing context |
| 16-20 | Problem crystal clear: who, what, when, impact quantified |

**Questions if low**:
- "What specific problem are you trying to solve?"
- "Who experiences this? How often?"
- "What's the cost of not solving this?"

### 2. Goal Definition (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | No goals stated |
| 6-10 | Vague aspirations ("make it better") |
| 11-15 | Goals stated but unmeasurable |
| 16-20 | SMART goals with specific metrics |

**Questions if low**:
- "What does success look like?"
- "How will you measure whether this worked?"
- "What specific metric should change? By how much?"

### 3. Success Criteria (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | None provided |
| 6-10 | Subjective criteria only |
| 11-15 | Some measurable criteria but incomplete |
| 16-20 | Clear, testable acceptance criteria for ALL goals |

**Questions if low**:
- "How will you know when this is done?"
- "What tests would prove this works?"
- "What would you demo to prove success?"

### 4. Scope Boundaries (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Unlimited scope |
| 6-10 | Some boundaries implied but not explicit |
| 11-15 | Boundaries stated but gaps exist |
| 16-20 | Clear in/out of scope with rationale |

**Questions if low**:
- "What is explicitly NOT part of this project?"
- "What's the MVP vs. nice-to-have?"
- "If you had to ship in half the time, what would you cut?"

### 5. Consistency (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Major contradictions |
| 6-10 | Some conflicting statements |
| 11-15 | Minor inconsistencies |
| 16-20 | Internally consistent throughout |

**Questions if low**:
- "You mentioned [X] but also [Y]. Which takes priority?"
- "How should we handle [edge case where requirements conflict]?"

## Confidence Thresholds

| Total | Action |
|-------|--------|
| < 70 | Major gaps - ask 5+ questions |
| 70-84 | Moderate gaps - ask 3-5 questions |
| 85-94 | Minor gaps - ask 1-2 questions |
| >= 95 | Ready - generate contract |
