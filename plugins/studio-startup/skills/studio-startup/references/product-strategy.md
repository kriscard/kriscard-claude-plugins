# Product Strategy

Strategic product leadership reference for studio-startup workflow.

## Core Frameworks

- **OKRs**: Objectives and Key Results for goal alignment
- **RICE**: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort for prioritization
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**: Customer motivation over feature requests
- **North Star Metric**: Single metric capturing core value delivery

## OKR Cascade

```
Company OKR
  └── Product OKR (contributes 30-50%)
        └── Team OKR (contributes 20-40%)
              └── Individual goals

Alignment check: Every team OKR should trace to company objectives.
```

## Strategy Types

| Strategy | Focus | Key Metrics |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Growth | Acquisition, expansion | MAU, signups, activation |
| Retention | Engagement, loyalty | Churn, NPS, DAU/MAU |
| Revenue | Monetization | ARPU, LTV, conversion |
| Innovation | New markets | Experiments, time-to-market |

## RICE Prioritization

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach:      Users affected per quarter
Impact:     0.25 (minimal) → 3 (massive)
Confidence: 50% → 100%
Effort:     Person-weeks
```

## Team Structure

```
Product Org Ratios:
- PM:Engineers        = 1:8-10
- Designer:PM         = 1:2
- Researcher:PM       = 1:4-6

Squad composition:
- 1 PM + 1 Designer + 4-8 Engineers
```

## OKR Template

```markdown
## Objective: [Qualitative, inspiring goal]

KR2: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]
KR3: [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]

Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]

```

## Product Vision (1-Pager)

```markdown
## For [target customer]
