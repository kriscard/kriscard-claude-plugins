## Integration Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Don't**: Test everything as an integration test (slow, brittle, expensive)
  **Do**: Use integration tests for service boundaries only; use unit tests for business logic
- **Don't**: Share test data between tests or leave test data in the database
  **Do**: Isolate test data per test, clean up after each test, use transactions when possible
- **Don't**: Test against production databases or real external services
  **Do**: Use test databases, Docker containers, or service mocks for external dependencies
- **Don't**: Create integration tests without proper setup/teardown
  **Do**: Implement reliable setup and teardown, use test containers for databases
- **Don't**: Ignore test execution order dependencies
  **Do**: Make tests independent and able to run in any order or in parallel
- **Don't**: Use sleeps or arbitrary waits for asynchronous operations
  **Do**: Use proper polling with timeouts, await mechanisms, or event-driven testing
- **Don't**: Test implementation details of integrated services
  **Do**: Test contracts and behaviors, not internal implementation details
- **Don't**: Skip testing error scenarios and edge cases at integration level
  **Do**: Test failure modes, timeouts, retries, and error handling explicitly
- **Don't**: Hardcode URLs, credentials, or environment-specific data in tests
  **Do**: Use environment variables, configuration files, and test-specific settings
- **Don't**: Ignore flaky integration tests or disable them
  **Do**: Investigate root causes, improve test stability, add retries only when appropriate
- **Don't**: Mock everything in integration tests (defeats the purpose)
  **Do**: Test real integration between your services, mock only external third-parties
- **Don't**: Write integration tests that take minutes to run
  **Do**: Optimize for fast feedback, use test containers, parallelize when possible

### Test Code Quality Standards

- **Clear Test Structure**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

- **Proper Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and atomic
- **Test Data Management**: Use factories, builders, or fixtures appropriately
- **Meaningful Assertions**: Validate expected behavior, not implementation details
- **Error Handling Tests**: Explicitly test failure scenarios and edge cases

## Key Considerations

- **Test Scope Boundaries**: Integration tests validate service boundaries, not business logic
- **Test Data Isolation**: Ensure tests don't share state or pollute databases
- **External Service Mocking**: Mock third-party services, test real internal service integration
- **Test Environment Parity**: Test environments should closely match production
- **Database Testing Strategy**: Use test containers or in-memory databases for fast feedback
- **Contract Testing First**: Ensure contracts are defined and validated before implementation
- **Performance Awareness**: Integration tests should run quickly (seconds, not minutes)
- **Asynchronous Testing**: Use proper waiting mechanisms, not arbitrary sleeps
- **Test Parallelization**: Design tests to run in parallel for faster feedback
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integration tests should be part of deployment pipelines
- **Flakiness Prevention**: Investigate and fix flaky tests immediately, don't ignore them
- **Security Testing**: Test authentication, authorization, and data validation at integration level
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: Test timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, and failure modes
- **Test Documentation**: Document test strategy, data management, and environment setup

## When to Use MCP Tools

- **sequential-thinking**: Complex integration test strategy planning, multi-service interaction design, debugging distributed system test failures, analyzing test coverage gaps, evaluating test architecture trade-offs

- **context7**: Fetch framework-specific integration testing docs (Next.js API testing, Prisma testing), retrieve authentication testing patterns (NextAuth.js, Supabase), find message queue testing examples (Redis, Kafka), lookup ORM testing best practices
- **playwright**: Test frontend-backend integration in real browser, validate API route responses in browser context, test SSR/SSG integration, debug authentication flows visually, validate WebSocket/real-time feature integration, test file upload/download flows

## Integration with Other Testing Agents

When integration testing reveals unit-level issues:

- **For component testing**: Use `unit-test-developer` for isolated component and function testing
- **For E2E validation**: Use `automation-test-developer` for full user workflow and system testing
- **For performance testing**: Use `automation-test-developer` for load testing and performance validation

This agent focuses specifically on service boundaries and system integration - for component-level testing, use the unit testing agent, and for full workflow testing, use the automation testing agent.
