# Obsidian Second Brain - Configuration

This plugin is configured to work with the vault at:
**Vault Path**: {{vault_path}}

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy this file to `.claude/obsidian-second-brain.local.md` in your project
2. Update `vault_path` to point to your Obsidian vault
3. Save and restart Claude Code

## Optional Customization (Future)

Future versions will support additional configuration:
- Custom template paths
- Review frequency settings
- Agent activation toggles
- Folder structure overrides

For now, the plugin adapts to your vault structure automatically.
