# Vault Structure & Configuration

Obsidian vault implementing a modified PARA method with MOCs, Bases, and a subject-only tagging system.

**Vault Path:** `/Users/kriscard/obsidian-vault-kriscard`

## Core Folder Structure

```
├── 0 - Inbox/              # Unprocessed notes, process weekly
├── 1 - Projects/           # Active work with deadlines
├── 2 - Areas/              # Ongoing responsibilities
│   ├── Daily Ops/          # Daily notes (YYYY/), weekly planning
│   ├── Goals/              # Quarterly/, Monthly/, Yearly/
│   └── Relationships/      # People notes
├── 3 - Resources/          # Reference materials
│   └── TIL/                # Today I Learned notes
├── 4 - Archives/           # Completed/inactive items
├── MOCs/                   # Maps of Content (navigation)
└── Templates/              # Note templates
```

## PARA Decision Making

### Where Should This Note Go?

1. **Active project with a deadline?** -> `1 - Projects/[Project Name]/`
2. **Ongoing responsibility?** -> `2 - Areas/[Area Name]/`
3. **Reference material for future use?** -> `3 - Resources/`
4. **Daily/temporal tracking?** -> `2 - Areas/Daily Ops/` or `2 - Areas/Goals/`
5. **Unprocessed or uncertain?** -> `0 - Inbox/`
6. **Completed or inactive?** -> `4 - Archives/`

**Key principles:**
- **Projects** - Time-bound, specific outcome, will move to Archives
- **Areas** - Ongoing, no end date, standard to maintain
- **Resources** - Passive reference, no immediate action required
- **Archives** - Completed projects, inactive areas, outdated resources

## Bases (Queryable Dashboards)

| Base | Path |
|------|------|
| Daily Notes | `2 - Areas/Daily Ops/Daily Notes.base` |
| Weekly Planning | `2 - Areas/Daily Ops/Weekly Planning.base` |
| OKR Dashboard | `2 - Areas/Goals/OKR Dashboard.base` |
| Books | `3 - Resources/Books/0 - Books.base` |
| TIL Index | `3 - Resources/TIL/TIL Index.base` |
| Active Projects | `MOCs/Active Projects.base` |

```bash
obsidian bases                                                          # List all bases
obsidian base:query path="2 - Areas/Goals/OKR Dashboard.base" format=json  # Query a base
```

## Maps of Content (MOCs)

**Location:** `MOCs/` | **Template:** `MOC Template.md`

**When to create:**
- Topic has 10+ related notes
- Need overview of a knowledge area
- Connecting multiple projects/areas
- Want to explain concept structure

Use Dataview queries for dynamic content. Link across PARA categories. Update during monthly reviews.

## Linking Conventions

```markdown
[[Note Name]]              # Standard link
[[Note Name|Display Text]] # Aliased link
[[Note Name#Heading]]      # Section link
[[Note Name#^block-id]]    # Block reference
```

Link freely across PARA boundaries — projects to areas, areas to resources, everything to MOCs.

## Gotchas

- **Don't duplicate folder context with tags** — if note is in `1 - Projects/`, don't tag it `#project`
- **Daily notes go in `2 - Areas/Daily Ops/YYYY/`**, not in root or Inbox
- **Always use `silent` flag** when creating/appending via CLI to avoid Obsidian stealing focus
- **MOCs: wait for 10+ related notes** — premature MOCs become maintenance burden
- **Archives folder uses year suffix:** `4 - Archives/Projects - YYYY/`

## Reading Vault Files

```bash
# Read files
obsidian read path="3 - Resources/Obsidian org/Tag Taxonomy.md"
obsidian read path="3 - Resources/Obsidian org/PARA Method Implementation.md"

# List files
obsidian files folder="0 - Inbox/" format=json

# Helper script
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/read-vault-file.sh "Tag Taxonomy.md"
```

## Reference Files

| Reference | Contents |
